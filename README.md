# **üí°Project Motivation**

Meet **Khushi**, a data science graduate excited to start her career but feeling overwhelmed by the challenges of breaking into the competitive job market. Like many new graduates, Khushi struggles with interview anxiety. The moment she sits in front of an interviewer, her mind goes blank. She finds it especially hard to confidently tackle technical questions or articulate her achievements.

Khushi‚Äôs journey into data science is still in its early stages‚Äîshe doesn‚Äôt have much experience yet and often feels unsure about how to prepare for interviews effectively. To make things harder, Khushi sometimes feels she's behind her peers. Many of them seem to have stronger technical skills or more impressive projects, leaving her with a sense of playing catch-up.

**That‚Äôs where LiA steps in.**

# **üé¢Project** 
## **üß†LiA's Brain: Our LLM Agents**
At the core of LiA lies a sophisticated network of Language Model (LLM) agents, each designed to enhance your interview preparation experience. These agents leverage advanced AI technologies to provide personalized support, guidance, and feedback tailored to your unique needs.

Together, these agents form a comprehensive support system, empowering Khushi to tackle interviews with confidence and skill.

### **üí¨Question Generation Agent**
This agent takes key information about the candidate‚Äôs prior experience, project background, and details of the role they are preparing for‚Äîsuch as a **Data Scientist position in the Gaming Industry**. By leveraging this contextual data, the agent formulates highly relevant and customized interview questions that align with both the candidate‚Äôs expertise and the target industry.

**Input Gathering**: The agent collects input on the candidate‚Äôs past roles, project details, target industry, and role requirements to build a comprehensive profile.

**LLM Integration**: This profile is then fed into Gemini by LiA, and is optimized through prompt engineering. By crafting precise prompts, Gemini is guided to generate questions that reflect the nuances of the candidate‚Äôs background in relation to their future role.

**Industry & Experience-Personalized Questions**: The model generates a set of personalized interview questions, drawing on industry trends, specific technical skills, and behavioral competencies tailored to the Data Scientist in Gaming scenario (or similar positions).

### **üë©‚Äçüî¨Expert Agent**
The **Expert Agent** is your personal interview coach within LiA, specializing in generating high-quality, customized example answers for interview questions. Designed to help users understand and convey their skills effectively, the Expert Agent tailors its responses using key details from both the user‚Äôs resume and the target job description. This customization allows users to see how to leverage their unique experiences, skills, and qualifications to meet job-specific expectations.

**Version Testing and Enhancements**
To ensure the best performance, we developed and tested three different versions of the Expert Agent:

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: The RAG model combines retrieval-based methods with generative AI, allowing it to pull specific examples from the user‚Äôs background and tailor answers more precisely. RAG excels in delivering in-depth, contextually relevant responses, making it ideal for candidates with rich experience who need to emphasize particular achievements.

- **Chain of Thought (CoT)**: The CoT version focuses on reasoning through multi-step questions. For instance, when generating answers for behavioral questions, the CoT model breaks down the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) format, guiding users through each part of a well-structured response. This version is beneficial for tackling complex questions requiring detailed answers and logical reasoning.

- **Baseline Version**: The baseline model simply calls the LLM API to generate example answers without employing advanced techniques like RAG or CoT. While it still uses the user‚Äôs background and job description to create relevant responses, it provides a straightforward, efficient output. This version serves as a foundational approach, ideal for generating initial answer drafts that users can further refine.


### **üíØEvaluation Agent**
**Scoring Rubric Development**

Informed by extensive research and insights from data science professionals who have experience with the big tech companies, we developed a comprehensive scoring rubric for evaluating interview responses. This rubric serves as the foundation for assessing user performance within the LiA platform.

**Evaluation Process**

Our Evaluation Agent leverages this scoring rubric to assess user answers to interview questions. Using advanced prompt engineering techniques, the agent provides not only a detailed score but also a clear rationale for each evaluation. This ensures users understand the reasoning behind their scores and receive actionable feedback to improve their responses.



## **ü§†LiA's Real Time Information: Tracking Your Confidence in Real-Time**
### **üí¨Resume Parser**

The first step in the LiA platform is collecting detailed user information, such as experiences and projects, by extracting key details from their resumes. Recognizing the diverse formats of resumes, the system standardizes extracted data for consistency while ensuring user privacy by removing any personal information.


### **üó£Ô∏èVoice Sensor**
LiA's voice sensor employs advanced audio processing to analyze key vocal characteristics that contribute to interview success. By measuring specific acoustic features in real-time, we provide insights into how your voice may be perceived by interviewers:

- Conversational Flow: Tracks the percentage of unvoiced segments and average pause duration to assess natural speech rhythm and fluency

- Confidence: Measures voice intensity mean to evaluate projected confidence and assertiveness

- Expressiveness: Analyzes fundamental frequency variation (F1 Standard Deviation) to gauge vocal dynamism and engagement

- Voice Modulation: Monitors average frequency band characteristics to detect monotone speech patterns that might indicate nervousness or disengagement

- Clarity: Evaluates the relationship between third and first formant frequencies to assess speech articulation and pronunciation clarity

### **üé¶Facial Expression Sensor**
LiA's facial expression sensor leverages state-of-the-art computer vision technology to interpret your non-verbal communication during interviews. Here's how it works:

- Emotion Recognition: The sensor detects micro-expressions and emotional cues, identifying feelings such as happiness, surprise, fear, and confusion. This helps you understand how your emotional responses might be perceived by an interviewer.
  
- Smile Detection: LiA monitors the frequency and authenticity of your smiles. A genuine smile can convey confidence and friendliness, while a lack of smiling may come across as disengagement.
  
- Eye Contact Analysis: Maintaining appropriate eye contact is crucial in building rapport. The sensor tracks your gaze to assess how well you maintain eye contact, providing feedback on your attentiveness and confidence.
  
- Engagement Level: By analyzing a combination of facial movements and expressions, LiA gauges your overall engagement during the interview, highlighting potential ways for overall improvement. 


## **üë•LiA's Interface: Your Interview Playground**
LiA's interface is designed to provide an immersive and interactive interview experience that closely mimics real-life scenarios. Here's what you can expect:

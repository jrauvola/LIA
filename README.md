# **üé¢Project** 
## **üß†LiA's Brain: Our LLM Agents**
At the core of LiA lies a sophisticated network of Language Model (LLM) agents, each designed to enhance your interview preparation experience. These agents leverage advanced AI technologies to provide personalized support, guidance, and feedback tailored to your unique needs.

Together, these agents form a comprehensive support system, empowering Khushi to tackle interviews with confidence and skill.

### **üí¨Question Generation Agent**
This agent takes key information about the candidate‚Äôs prior experience, project background, and details of the role they are preparing for‚Äîsuch as a **Data Scientist position in the Gaming Industry**. By leveraging this contextual data, the agent formulates highly relevant and customized interview questions that align with both the candidate‚Äôs expertise and the target industry.

#### **How It Works**

**Input Gathering**: The agent collects input on the candidate‚Äôs past roles, project details, target industry, and role requirements to build a comprehensive profile.

**LLM Integration**: This profile is then fed into Gemini by LiA, and is optimized through prompt engineering. By crafting precise prompts, Gemini is guided to generate questions that reflect the nuances of the candidate‚Äôs background in relation to their future role.

**Industry & Experience-Personalized Questions**: The model generates a set of personalized interview questions, drawing on industry trends, specific technical skills, and behavioral competencies tailored to the Data Scientist in Gaming scenario (or similar positions).

### **üë©‚Äçüî¨Expert Agent**
The **Expert Agent** is your personal interview coach within LiA, specializing in generating high-quality, customized example answers for interview questions. Designed to help users understand and convey their skills effectively, the Expert Agent tailors its responses using key details from both the user‚Äôs resume and the target job description. This customization allows users to see how to leverage their unique experiences, skills, and qualifications to meet job-specific expectations.

**Version Testing and Enhancements**
To ensure the best performance, we developed and tested three different versions of the Expert Agent:

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: The RAG model combines retrieval-based methods with generative AI, allowing it to pull specific examples from the user‚Äôs background and tailor answers more precisely. RAG excels in delivering in-depth, contextually relevant responses, making it ideal for candidates with rich experience who need to emphasize particular achievements.

- **Chain of Thought (CoT)**: The CoT version focuses on reasoning through multi-step questions. For instance, when generating answers for behavioral questions, the CoT model breaks down the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) format, guiding users through each part of a well-structured response. This version is beneficial for tackling complex questions requiring detailed answers and logical reasoning.

- **Baseline Version**: The baseline model simply calls the LLM API to generate example answers without employing advanced techniques like RAG or CoT. While it still uses the user‚Äôs background and job description to create relevant responses, it provides a straightforward, efficient output. This version serves as a foundational approach, ideal for generating initial answer drafts that users can further refine.


### **üíØEvaluation Agent**

# **üó∫Ô∏èInterview Journey with LiA**

The Interview Journey with LiA begins when users share their professional background and target job description, enabling LiA to craft a personalized interview experience that bridges their past experience with their desired role. After a brief animation sequence, users are transported into a simulated video call environment where they see themselves in a small frame, with LiA's lifelike presence commanding most of the screen. The interview unfolds across five carefully curated questions, with users noticing an increasing level of personalization as they progress. This deepening relevance stems from LiA's sophisticated ability to incorporate previous responses, analyzing transcripts and user information to generate increasingly targeted questions after the initial standardized opener.

Following the interview, users are guided through a comprehensive three-part feedback experience. The journey begins with the Social Skills Feedback section, where users encounter a detailed scoreboard evaluating their communication style, vocal qualities, and overall demeanor‚Äîleveraging LiA's advanced capacity to analyze not just verbal content but also audio and visual cues. Next, the Technical Skills Feedback screen provides clear thumbs-up or thumbs-down assessments for technical responses, mirroring evaluation methods used by leading technology companies. The experience culminates in an interactive transcript review where users can compare their responses against expert-crafted answers generated by the Gemini LLM, complete with specific improvement recommendations from LiA. Users can then choose to restart the process, armed with these insights, to refine their interview performance across all dimensions.

## **üì∑Customized Experience**

LiA distinguishes itself from traditional interview preparation tools through its ability to create a deeply personalized experience that adapts to each user's unique professional background and career aspirations.

At the heart of the application lies a sophisticated question generation system that creates a uniquely tailored interview experience for each user. While the first question serves as a standardized opener, the subsequent four questions are dynamically generated based on a rich combination of inputs: the user's provided background information, the target job description, and most impressively, the actual transcripts from previous answers within the same session. This creates an increasingly personalized interview path where each question builds meaningfully upon the last, simulating the natural flow of a real technical interview.

The application's evaluation systems are equally customized, with both technical and social skills assessments adapting to the specific requirements of the user's target role. The technical assessment criteria are carefully calibrated to mirror the actual hiring processes of major tech companies, with evaluation metrics and feedback specifically tuned to the user's intended domain, whether it be frontend development, backend engineering, or machine learning. Similarly, the social skills analysis employs a sophisticated multimodal approach, analyzing verbal content, audio characteristics, and visual cues, with the importance of each factor weighted according to the specific demands of the target role‚Äîfor instance, placing higher emphasis on communication style for customer-facing positions.

The final layer of customization appears in the application's feedback and improvement systems. Rather than providing genKhushi "perfect answers," the system generates expert responses that precisely match the technical depth, communication style, and specific requirements of the target role and company. This customization extends into the improvement pathway, where the feedback loop prioritizes suggestions based on the user's most significant areas for growth. The system maintains a memory of previous performance metrics, allowing users to track their progress over time and focus their practice on the areas that will most impact their interview success.

## **üéπInteractive Session**

The user's interactive journey with LiA begins at the "About You" interface, where they actively shape their upcoming interview experience by providing key information about their background, skills, and aspirations. This initial interaction goes beyond simple form-filling ‚Äì users engage in a dynamic process of describing their professional journey and uploading their target job description, each input helping to craft the parameters of their personalized mock interview experience.

The heart of user interaction occurs during the mock interview itself, where users engage with LiA in a uniquely unpredictable conversation. Unlike traditional interview prep tools with pre-scripted questions, users must think on their feet as they respond to LiA's dynamically generated questions. This creates a genuinely interactive experience where each answer influences the AI's generation of subsequent questions, making every interview session unique and challenging in its own way. The real-time video interface, complete with the user's self-view window, adds another layer of interactivity as users must manage both their verbal responses and visual presentation.

The final interactive component empowers users to take control of their learning journey through an extensive feedback exploration system. Users can navigate through various performance metrics, drilling down into specific areas where improvement is needed. This interactive feedback system allows users to toggle between different scorecards, compare their responses with expert answers, and deeply examine areas marked for improvement. This self-directed exploration enables users to focus their attention on the aspects of their interview performance that need the most work, creating a personalized learning experience that extends beyond the interview itself.
